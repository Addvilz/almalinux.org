    question: Who is AlmaLinux OS for?
    answer: >
      Individuals and organizations that require an enterprise-grade, Fedora-like distribution but who
      do not want to or cannot pay for a RHEL&reg; license. AlmaLinux OS is also a perfect replacement
      for anyone who currently relies on the CentOS stable release to achieve computing objectives.

    question: Why did we call it AlmaLinux OS?
    answer: >
      Alma means soul in Spanish and other Latin languages. Looking back, it is easy to see that Linux
      is as popular and pervasive as it is thanks to the efforts of a passionate, diverse developer
      community. This community is the soul of Linux, and everyone that relies on a Linux distribution
      is indebted to the efforts of the Linux community. That is why we called our new distribution
      AlmaLinux OS.

    question: Why should I rely on CloudLinux for a CentOS alternative?
    answer: >
      CloudLinux's core product, the CloudLinux OS, is a RHEL&reg; fork that has been in place for
      over ten years. More than 4,000 companies including Dell, Liquid Web, and 1&1 rely on the CloudLinux OS
      across more than 200,000 product installations. CloudLinux has proven experience in creating and
      maintaining a RHEL fork and have done so starting with RHEL release 5, right through to release
      8. AlmaLinux OS is an opportunity for us to channel our expertise in RHEL into a Linux
      distribution that serves the broader community. Furthermore, we are including the Linux
      community right from the inception of AlmaLinux OS. Moving forward, community members will be on
      the governing board for the AlmaLinux OS project and involved in key decisions too. Finally,
      AlmaLinux OS will always be free and open source. The community can pick up and continue to
      develop AlmaLinux OS at any time.

    question: I want to convert from CentOS to AlmaLinux OS. How do I do it?

      Switching Linux distros can be a headache, but that is not the case when switching from CentOS
      to AlmaLinux OS. Just like CentOS, AlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL&reg;, so
      switching is simple.

      applications and services will remain compatible. For that reason, you can rapidly migrate any
