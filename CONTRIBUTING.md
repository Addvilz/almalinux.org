# Contributing

If you are interested in making a contribution there are a few ways you could help out the project.

## Filing issues

- Work on AlmaLinux OS web presence is managed
  in [JIRA Web Presence project](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9) and is the preferred place
  for submitting issues, bugs and feature requests.
- You are free to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) to submit bugs and for
  discussions related to the codebase.

Both JIRA Web Presence project and GitHub issues are used to track community feedback, however **JIRA Web Presence project
 is primary** and all web presence related work will is managed there, whereas GitHub serves as primary point for
community input.

Community members can choose to submit issues in either, whereas AlmaLinux OS organization members should prioritize use
of JIRA instead.

### Reporting a Bug

Good bug reports can be very helpful. A bug is a demonstrable problem with the code or functionality.

Please use the [JIRA Web Presence project](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9)
and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) â€” check if the issue has already been reported.

A good bug report should be as detailed as possible, so that others won't have to follow up for the essential details.

- Submit a bug in [JIRA Web Presence project](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9); OR
- Submit a bug in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues)

### Requesting a Feature

1. [Search the issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) for any previous requests for the same
   feature, and give a thumbs up or +1 on existing requests.
1. If no previous requests exist, create a new issue. Please be as clear as possible about why the feature is needed and
   the intended use case.

- Request a feature in [JIRA Web Presence project](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9); OR
- Request a feature in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues)

## Contributing code

If you plan to propose code changes it is required you create
an [issue](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9) with a brief proposal and discuss it with
us first.

This is necessary to avoid more than one contributor working on the same feature/change and to avoid someone from
spending time on feature/change that would not be merged for any reason.

For smaller contributions use this workflow:

* Create an [issue](https://almalinux.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9) describing the changes.
* Await confirmation from contributors.
* Fork the project.
* Create a branch for your feature or bug fix.
* Add code changes, relevant documentation, etc.
* Send a pull request.

After one of the contributors has checked and approved the changes, they will be merged into master branch and will be
included in the next deployment.

## Approval of changes

Before any changes can be merged:

- All minor or cosmetic changes (typos, minor styling, etc) can be approved and merged by any contributor with master
  merge rights,
- All non-cosmetic changes to the website requires the approval of the Web Team lead and at least one other Web Team
  member.
- All major changes that are not purely technical, and fundamental changes in technology requires the approval of the
  AlmaLinux OS Community Manager.
